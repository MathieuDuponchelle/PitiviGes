NAME
----
ges-launch-1.0-clip - Add a clip to the timeline

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ges-launch-1.0 clip' 	  <path|uri> [i=<inpoint>|inpoint=<inpoint>]
			[d=<duration>|duration=<duration>]
			[s=<start>|start=<start>] [l=<layer>|layer=<layer>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Adds a clip to the timeline.

See documentation for the --track-types option to ges-launch-1.0,
as it will affect the result of this command.

MANDATORY ARGUMENTS
-------------------

path|uri::
	Specifies the location of the sample to make a clip from.

OPTIONS
-------

i::
inpoint=<inpoint>::
	Sets the inpoint of the clip, that is the position in the original sample
	at which the clip will start outputting data.

	It is an error to have an inpoint superior to the actual duration of the original sample.

	0 by default.

d::
duration=<duration>::
	Sets the duration of the clip, that is the duration of the media the clip will output.

	It is an error to have inpoint + duration be superior to the duration of the
	original sample.

	The default is the duration of the original sample - the inpoint of the clip.

s::
start=<start>::
	Sets the start of the clip, that is its position in the timeline.

	If not specified, it will be set to the duration of the layer the clip is added on,
	as the expected default behaviour is to queue clips one after another.

	See ges-launch-1.0 help timeline for more information.

l::
layer=<layer>::
	Sets the layer of the clip. The video stream in overlapping clips on different layers
	will be blended together according to their alpha property, starting with the clip
	on the last layer. An example is shown in the EXAMPLES section.

	If not specified, it will be set to the last layer a clip has been added on, or
	a first layer if no clip has been added yet.

	See ges-launch-1.0 help timeline for more information.

PROPERTIES
----------

See ges-launch-1.0 help set-property for more information.

Video properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These have no effects if there is no video stream in the sample.

alpha::
	This is the amount of transparency of the clip, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0
	Clips overlapping on different layers will be composited together, unless
	--disable-mixing has been specified, in the order of the layers.

	See ges-launch-1.0 help timeline for more information.

posx::
	This is the x position (offset) of the clip in pixels, relatively to the output frame of the
	timeline.

posy::
	This is the y position (offset) of the clip in pixels, relatively to the output frame of the
	timeline.

width::
	This is the width in pixels that the clip will occupy in the final output frame.

height::
	This is the height in pixels that the clip will occupy in the final output frame.

Audio properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

volume::
	This is the volume that will be set on the audio part of the clip, ranging from
	0.0 to 10.0, with 1.0 being the default.

mute::
	Set to true to mute the audio of the clip. Default is false.


EXAMPLES
--------

`ges-launch-1.0 clip /path/to/media`::
	This will simply play the sample from its beginning to its end.

`ges-launch-1.0 clip /path/to/media inpoint=4.0`::
	Assuming "media" is a 10 second long media sample, this will
	play the sample from the 4th second to the 10th, resulting in a
	6-seconds long playback.

`ges-launch-1.0 clip /path/to/media inpoint=4.0 duration=2.0 start=4.0`::
	Assuming "media" is an audio video sample longer than 6 seconds, this
	will play a black frame and silence for 4 seconds, then the sample
	from its 4th second to its sixth second, resulting in a 6-seconds
	long playback.

`ges-launch-1.0 --track-types=audio clip /path/to/media`::
	Assuming "media" is an audio video sample, this will only play the audio
	of the sample in its entirety.

`ges-launch-1.0 clip /path/to/media1 layer=1 set-alpha 0.9 clip /path/to/media2 layer=0`::
	Assume media1 and media2 both contain audio and video and last for 10 seconds.
	This will first add media1 in a new layer of "priority" 1, thus implicitly creating
	a layer of "priority" 0, the start of the clip will be 0 as no clip had been added
	in that layer before.

	It will then add media2 in the layer of "priority" 0 which was created previously,
	the start of this new clip will also be 0 as no clip has been added in this layer before.

	Both clips will thus overlap on two layers for 10 seconds.

	The "alpha" property of the second clip will finally be set to a value of 0.9.

	All this will result in a 10 seconds playback, where media2 is barely visible
	through media1, which is nearly opaque. If alpha was set to 0.5, both clips
	would be equally visible, and if it was set to 0.0, media1 would be invisible
	and media2 completely opaque.
