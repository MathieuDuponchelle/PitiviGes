Adding an effect to a clip with no compatible streams will have no effect.

MANDATORY ARGUMENTS

bin-description::
	Specifies the description of a GStreamer a bin, in the gst-launch format.

OPTIONS
-------

s::
start=<start>::
	Sets the start of the effect, that is its position in the timeline.

	If specified, duration is mandatory.

	If neither duration or start are specified, the effect will be applied
	to the last clip added in the timeline.

d::
duration=<duration>::
	Sets the duration of the effect.

	If specified, start is mandatory.

	If neither duration or start are specified, the effect will be applied
	to the last clip added in the timeline.

l::
layers=<layers>::
	Specifies the layer(s) on which to apply the effect. Has no effect when
	the effect gets applied to last clip.

	layers is a list of colon-delimited layer-priorities, for instance
	layers=1:3.

	If not specified, the effect will be applied to all the layers.

PROPERTIES
----------

See ges-launch-1.0 help set-property for more information.

Properties can be set on the effect either directly in the bin-description,
or separately through the set-* command, which will lookup any readable
property in any of the children of the bin, and set the provided value on
it.

Property names can be looked up with gst-inspect my_element.

EXAMPLES
--------

`ges-launch-1.0 clip /path/to/media effect "agingtv"`::
	This will apply the agingtv effect to "media" and play it back.

`ges-launch-1.0 clip /path/to/media effect "agingtv" set-dusts false`::
	This will apply the agingtv effect to "media", set the "dusts" property to false
	and play "media" back.

`ges-launch-1.0 clip /path/to/media effect "agingtv" start=2.0 duration=4.0`::
	Assuming "media" is a 10 seconds long video sample, this will play back
	"media" for 2 seconds normally, then for 4 seconds with agingtv applied, then
	normally again for the last 4 seconds.
