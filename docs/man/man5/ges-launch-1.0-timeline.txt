NAME
----
ges-launch-1.0-timeline - The GES timeline

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A GES Timeline is composed of one or more layers, and produces data on one or more tracks.

A track represents a media type, for example audio, video or text. For the moment only 
audio and video tracks are supported.

Layers contain clips, and represent the relative priorities of these clips.

Layers
~~~~~~

Let's imagine a timeline that contains two layers:

[verse]

  Timeline, duration : 0 seconds                                                                 
\+--------------------------------------------------------+                   
|                                                        |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|         |                                           |  |                   
| Layer 1 |                                           |  |                   
|         |                                           |  |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|                                                        |
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|         |                                           |  |                   
| Layer 2 |                                           |  |                   
|         |                                           |  |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|                                                        |                   
\+--------------------------------------------------------+                   

If we add two clips in layer 1 and layer 2, each starting at 0 with a duration of 10
seconds, our timeline now looks like this:

[verse]
  Timeline, duration : 10 seconds
\+--------------------------------------------------------+                   
|                                                        |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|         | \+=======================================+ |  |                   
| Layer 1 | |              Clip 1                   | |  |                   
|         | \+=======================================+ |  |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|                                                        |
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|         | \+=======================================+ |  |                   
| Layer 2 | |              Clip 2                   | |  |                   
|         | \+=======================================+ |  |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|                                                        |                   
\+--------------------------------------------------------+                  

In that timeline, Clip 2 is said to have the highest "priority". In the case of video streams,
it means that it will be rendered on top of Clip 1, which in turn signifies that if
Clip 1 and Clip 2 share the same width and height, Clip 1 will be completely invisible.

In the case of video streams, one can therefore think of the layer priority as a z-index.

See ges-launch-1.0 help clip for more info about layer, alpha, position and size properties.

Tracks
~~~~~~

Let's continue with that timeline. For now it indeed mixes various layers together, but it
doesn't output anything. That's what Tracks are for.

If we add a video track to our timeline, it can be represented that way:

[verse]
  Timeline, duration : 10 seconds
\+--------------------------------------------------------+                   
|                                                        |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|         | \+=======================================+ |  |                   
| Layer 1 | |              Clip 1                   | |  |                   
|         | \+=======================================+ |  |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|                                                        |--------> Video Track
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|         | \+=======================================+ |  |                   
| Layer 2 | |              Clip 2                   | |  |                   
|         | \+=======================================+ |  |                   
|         \+-------------------------------------------+  |                   
|                                                        |                   
\+--------------------------------------------------------+                  

Assuming both clips contain video streams, our timeline will now output the result of their
compositing together on the video track. Any audio streams they contain are ignored.

One can of course add an audio track to get audio output.

Having multiple tracks with the same type, for example 3 audio tracks, is useful if one wants
to link the timeline to a container that can store various languages, for example a DVD creator
might store English, Dutch and French audio tracks.

By default ges-launch-1.0 will assume the user wants exactly one audio track and one video track,
this can be modified through the --track-types argument to ges-launch-1.0 .
