GNonLin overview

GNonLin works as a companion library for GStreamer, in order to be able to
easily manipulate and assemble media streams through time, and use that 
composition in any GStreamer graph.

* GnlObject

 All gnonlin objects derive from this base class. It has the following 
properties:

 * Media start/stop time. This allows to select a specific time range from the 
   underlying media stream.

 * Start/Stop time. This allows to position the given object in it's parent 
   object.

 * (Order of) Priority. When you assemble several objects together and they 
   overlap in time, this property allows you to decide which one has priority 
   over the others. The lower the value, the higher the priority.

 * It derives from a GstBin, therefore all GNonLin elements can be used alone in
   a GStreamer graph.

* GnlSource

 Wrapper to use GStreamer source elements in GNonLin. In addition to GnlObject 
properties it has an element property which is the wrapped element.

* GnlOperation

 Wrapper to use GStreamer filter/effects elements in GNonLin. It can only support
elements with one output pad.

* GnlComposition

 Class for "combining" several "one source output" GnlObjects. Used as such it 
can only handle same-media type. In addition to adding/removing GnlObjects to 
it, you can also set a default source which will be played during "gaps".

* GnlTimeline

 Class for "combining" several GnlComposition together. This is the highest level
GNonLin element.
