1. Basic ideas
---------------

Basically, material is a way of avoiding duplicating data in timeline objects and solution
which will allow to have one common registry for timeline sources and timeline operations.

    * There will be registry of materials
    * Each type of material allow to create some particular TimelineObject
    * Materials will hold metadata
    * Materials can be registered at runtime

Some ideas of material(especially for TimelineSource objects) can be found in docs/random/design.

2. Problems
--------------
    1) We must be able to query list of materials that are available for use in some specific project
    2) We must be able to query materials by some criteria
        a. By type of TimelineObject that it can produce
        b. By type of supported tracks
        c. Should we have filters by some specific properties of source material
           - like duration, width, height, etc?

    4) We must be able to get reference to origin material of any timeline object.

3. Propositions to solve those problems
----------------------------------------

    1) To hold list of all available materials registry will be used. Every material
       should have unique identifier that might be exposed later via API.

    2) To allow library user to implement some sort of media library we must be able to query materials by
        using some criteria, e.g. URI or supported track types.

    3) To allow loading materials once we can create list of them in ges_init() and append this list
        each time we create project. In case of materials that need URI, we can have global hash table
        which will hold already loaded URIs and references to corresponding materials. So if URI
        is already loaded/discovered we won't do it for the second time. To free this data we can
        use approach of GStreamer - they will be freed automatically by system after program termination.

    4) To make it possible to get such data we could have some interface(GESMaterialInterface
       or GESExtractableObject, name to be defined) that will be implement by each type that can be instantiated via
       GESMaterial.

4. Use cases
-------------
    UC-1. Define media files and discover them
    UC-2. Define project - reference all materials
    UC-3. Define titles
    UC-4. Define operations
        - Transitions - 1 material per transition
        - Effects - 1 material per effects
        - TextOverlay
    UC-5. Handle metadata
    UC-6. Add operations (only effects?) to a GESTimelineObject
    UC-7. User want to 'invent' a new operation, we need to be able
          to let him define it
    UC-8. The user want to make an object from a GESMaterial
